# Eventick API PHP LIbrary
Use this API to integrate your app with eventick.com.br service. This is not a official library.

## Example
```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Eventick\Lib\EventickAPI;

$api = new EventickAPI;
$api->setCredentials('your-email', 'your-password');

$api->auth(); // Authenticates you
$events = $api->events(); // Grab events
...
```

## 

## Tests
To run your tests, first insert your Eventick credentials in ```test/testCredentials.php```. That's required because the library is not using Mocks or Stubs, just because PHP tests are trash. =)

After setup your credentials, run ```phpunit```.
